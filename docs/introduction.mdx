## What is WSX?

**WSX** is a modern, framework-agnostic WebSocket library that brings the simplicity and power of HTMX to real-time web applications. It enables developers to build reactive, real-time applications using familiar hypermedia patterns with WebSocket communication.

## Why Choose WSX?

### Simple Yet Powerful

WSX combines the simplicity of HTMX with the power of WebSockets, allowing you to build complex real-time applications with minimal JavaScript.

### Familiar Patterns

If you know HTMX, you already know WSX. The same declarative approach, the same swap patterns, just over WebSockets.

### Production Ready

Built with TypeScript, comprehensive error handling, and battle-tested WebSocket patterns.

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of a real-time counter:

```html
<!-- Client -->
<div wx-config='{"url": "ws://localhost:3000/ws"}'>
  <div id="counter">Count: 0</div>
  <button wx-send="increment" wx-target="#counter">Increment</button>
</div>
```

```javascript
// Server
wsx.on("increment", async (request, connection) => {
  const newCount = getCount() + 1;

  // Update all connected clients
  wsx.broadcast("#counter", `Count: ${newCount}`);

  return {
    id: request.id,
    target: request.target,
    html: `Count: ${newCount}`,
  };
});
```
