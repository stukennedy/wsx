## Package Overview

WSX is organized as a monorepo with separate packages for different use cases:

- **@wsx/core**: Core WSX server functionality (required)
- **@wsx/express**: Express.js adapter
- **@wsx/hono**: Hono framework adapter
- **@wsx/client**: Client-side JavaScript library

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

## Server Installation

### Express.js

For Express.js applications:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @wsx/core @wsx/express
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @wsx/core @wsx/express
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @wsx/core @wsx/express
```

</CodeGroup>

### Hono

For Hono applications (including Cloudflare Workers):

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @wsx/core @wsx/hono
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @wsx/core @wsx/hono
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @wsx/core @wsx/hono
```

</CodeGroup>

### Core Only

If you want to create a custom adapter:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @wsx/core
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @wsx/core
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @wsx/core
```

</CodeGroup>

## Client Installation

### Option 1: Download from Repository

Download the client library from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stukennedy/wsx/blob/main/packages/client/wsx.js) and include it in your HTML:

```html
<script src="/path/to/wsx.js"></script>
```

### Option 2: Copy from node_modules

If you've installed the server packages, you can copy the client from node_modules:

```bash
cp node_modules/@wsx/client/wsx.js public/wsx.js
```

### Option 3: CDN (Coming Soon)

We're working on CDN distribution. For now, use the download or copy methods above.

## TypeScript Support

WSX is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. No additional @types packages are needed.

```typescript
import { WSXServer, WSXRequest, WSXResponse } from "@wsx/core";
import { createExpressWSXServer } from "@wsx/express";

const wsx = createExpressWSXServer();

wsx.on("my-handler", async (request: WSXRequest, connection) => {
  const response: WSXResponse = {
    id: request.id,
    target: request.target,
    html: "<div>Hello TypeScript!</div>",
  };
  return response;
});
```

## Framework-Specific Setup

### Express.js

```javascript
import { createExpressWSXServer } from "@wsx/express";
import express from "express";

const wsx = createExpressWSXServer();
const app = wsx.getApp();

// Your Express middleware and routes
app.use(express.static("public"));

// WSX handlers
wsx.on("my-handler", async (request, connection) => {
  return {
    id: request.id,
    target: request.target,
    html: "<div>Hello from Express!</div>",
  };
});

const server = app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

### Hono

```javascript
import { createHonoWSXServer } from "@wsx/hono";

const wsx = createHonoWSXServer();
const app = wsx.getApp();

// Your Hono routes
app.get("/", (c) => c.html("<h1>Hello Hono!</h1>"));

// WSX handlers
wsx.on("my-handler", async (request, connection) => {
  return {
    id: request.id,
    target: request.target,
    html: "<div>Hello from Hono!</div>",
  };
});

export default {
  fetch: app.fetch,
};
```

### Cloudflare Workers

WSX works great with Cloudflare Workers using the Hono adapter:

```javascript
import { createHonoWSXServer } from "@wsx/hono";

const wsx = createHonoWSXServer();
const app = wsx.getApp();

// Your worker logic
wsx.on("worker-handler", async (request, connection) => {
  return {
    id: request.id,
    target: request.target,
    html: "<div>Hello from Cloudflare Workers!</div>",
  };
});

export default {
  fetch: app.fetch,
};
```

## Verification

To verify your installation is working:

1. **Server**: Check that you can import and create a WSX server:

```javascript
import { createExpressWSXServer } from "@wsx/express";
const wsx = createExpressWSXServer();
console.log("WSX server created successfully");
```

2. **Client**: Check that the client library loads without errors:

```html
<script src="/wsx.js"></script>
<script>
  console.log("WSX client loaded:", typeof WSX !== "undefined");
</script>
```

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Module not found errors">
    Make sure you've installed the correct packages for your framework: -
    Express: `@wsx/core` and `@wsx/express` - Hono: `@wsx/core` and `@wsx/hono`
    - Custom: `@wsx/core` only
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="TypeScript compilation errors">
    Ensure your TypeScript configuration includes the node_modules directory and
    that you're using TypeScript 4.5 or later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Client script not loading">
    Verify that the wsx.js file is in your public directory and accessible via
    HTTP. Check your server's static file serving configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WebSocket connection issues">
    If you're using a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache), make sure it's configured
    to handle WebSocket upgrades. See our [deployment
    guide](/advanced/deployment) for details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development vs Production

### Development

For development, you can use the debug mode:

```html
<div wx-config='{"url": "ws://localhost:3000/ws", "debug": true}'>
  <!-- Your content -->
</div>
```

### Production

For production, disable debug mode and use secure WebSocket connections:

```html
<div wx-config='{"url": "wss://your-domain.com/ws", "debug": false}'>
  <!-- Your content -->
</div>
```
